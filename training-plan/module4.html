							<li>Don't be afraid to reach out for help</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>No such thing as a dumb question, but there is a correct time and place for every question to be answered.</p>
							<p>Objective questions are good for search engines, but more subjective/guidance questions should be reserved for team
							members or supervisors. 
							</p>
							<p>You shouldn't be afraid to reach out for help if you ever feel stuck, but there needs to be effort on your end too. 
							There won't be any learning taking place if you don't take time to critically think about the problems first.

							<li>Can you review my code so I can be sure I'm moving in the right direction?</li>
							<li>I'm getting an error, and here is what I think it means...have you ever had
								any experience with it before?

					<h3>Research</h3>
					<p>While it isn't important to be an "expert" in order to tackle a problem, you don't need to know it all.</p>
					<p>Don't let fear of the unknown paralyze you, but don't waste people's time *(especially for objective questions).</p>
